<h1>How to use the Circle daemon</h1>

<p>
Circle uses a daemon, which connects to the circle network. When you
type 'circle', a daemon is started if there is none running, and the
user interface connects to it.

<p>However it is possible to publish files, and to query the Circle
network, without running the user interface.  To start the daemon,
type:

<p><b>circle start</b>

<p>You can check the status of the daemon (number of files published,
network usage, number of known peers) by typing the following:

<p><b>circle status</b>

<p>While the daemon is running, you can use your web browser as an
interface to Circle. Start the http service of the daemon by typing:

<p><b>circle http [local,remote]</b>

<p>You can search for people by typing:

<p><b>circle find</b> <it>keyword</it>

<p>You can search for files by typing:

<p><b>circle search</b> <it>keyword</it>

<p>You can download a file by typing:

<p><b>circle get</b> <it>url</it> 

<p>You can stop your running daemon by typing:

<p><b>circle stop</b>

<p>You can make the Circle daemon load automatically at boot time: (you have to be root to do this)

<p><b>circle autostart</b>

<p>If you no longer want the daemon to load automatically at boot, simply type:

<p><b>circle noautostart</b>
