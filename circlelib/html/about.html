<h1>About The Circle</h1>

<p>The Circle is free software, released under the GNU GPL.  This means you are free
to alter it and distribute it to your friends without my or anyone else's
permission, so long as you also make the source code available to them.
However, I ask you not to alter the underlying network code unless you really
know what you are doing, as a faulty peer could harm the Circle network.
