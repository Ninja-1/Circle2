<h2><a name="Preliminaries">1. Preliminaries</a></h2>
                
<h3>RedHat 9.0 users:</h3>
       Redhat 9.0 is shipped with a buggy version of glibc, that prevents 
Circle    from behaving properly.<br>
       In order to get around this, it is possible to use the RawHide RPMs: 
 <a
 href="ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/rawhide/1.0/i386/RedHat/RPMS/glibc-2.3.2-37.i386.rpm">glibc-2.3.2-37.i386.rpm</a> 
   or <a
 href="ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/rawhide/1.0/i386/RedHat/RPMS/glibc-2.3.2-37.i686.rpm">glibc-2.3.2-37.i686.rpm.</a><br>
       <br>

<h3>Gentoo GNU/Linux users:</h3>
The version of pygtk required to run Circle is currently masked as an unstable/testing package. There are two major methods that can be used to emerge the pygtk version that one needs:
<ul>
   <li>There is a variable known as ACCEPT_KEYWORDS which controls whether one gets stable or unstable ebuilds when emerging. In order to get unstable packages, one would use ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arch". So, for the x86 architecture, the following command could be used to emerge the correct version of pygtk:<br>
   #ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge '&gt;=emerge dev-python/pygtk-1.99.16'<br>
   The ACCEPT_KEYWORDS variable can also been set to unstable in make.conf, but this is very dangerous as all of the packages emerged will be unstable!
   <li>One can also edit the file $PORTDIR/dev-python/pygtk/pygtk-1.99.16.ebuild and remove the tilde (~) from one's architecture in the declaration of the KEYWORD variable.
</ul>
<br>
 
            
<h3>Windows XP users:</h3>
      To make circle (version 0.34) work on XP,  you may have to delete the 
 EMM32.dll  file to get putty working.  <br>
      To make circle (version 0.35) work on XP, you may have to add the directory 
  C:\Program Files\GTK\2.0\lib to your Path environment variable  <br>
       <br>
            
<h3>Circle and NAT:</h3>
                 
<p>If you have a direct connection to the internet, and you don't use BSD,
    you can skip ahead to the <a href="#Configuration">next</a>  section.
 Otherwise, welcome to the wonderful world of slightly broken internet protocols...<br>
        <br>
       A computer behind a NAT (aka masquerading) network is something of 
a  second   class citizen. It can connect to other machines, but other machines 
 can't   connect to it. Circle needs other computers to be able to contact 
 your computer,   so we need to use a little trickery to get things working. 
  </p>
             
<p> You have two options:  </p>
             
<ol>
        <li> run a proxy on a remote server (usually your firewall) </li>
         <li> configure your firewall to port forward UDP traffic for Circle
    </li>
             
</ol>
                
<p> Circle can usually detect when you are using NAT, and will offer to run 
   the proxy if there is NAT. You can also specify the exact options you want
   on the command line (run <tt>circle -h</tt> for a list of options).  </p>
             
<h4>The proxy</h4>
                
<p> Running a proxy sounds like a lot of stuffing about and bother, right?
     </p>
             
<p> Wrong (hopefully...)  </p>
             
<p> You'll need to have installed an SSH server and Python on the machine
    you want to run the proxy on, Circle can do the rest. When you run Circle, 
   it will ask you for the machine you want to use as the proxy. It will then
   connect to it using SSH and send the proxy  (which is a short Python program)
   over the network.     </p>
         
<h4>Configuring your firewall to pass Circle packets</h4>
                
<p> Ok, the previous section was the easy way. This is the hard way.  </p>
             
<p> If you can configure your firewall to forward all connection on the 
UDP port to your computer, circle should work. If more than one person is
 running circle within the internal network, each computer will have to 
be associated to a dedicated port in the 29610+ range.  </p>
             
<p> You will then have to use circle with the -d option. Windows users, create 
   a shortcut of the program, edit it with properties and add the -d to the 
  command line  </p>
             
<p> <b> If your computer or firewall does some kind of packet filtering, please
make  sure it doesn't reject UDP packets for ports in the range 29610 to
29619. </b>  </p>
             
<p> Linux firewall IP table rule could look like (this is not for copy and 
   paste) </p>
             
<pre>	iptables -A GROUP -p udp -m udp --dport 29610 -j UDPACCEPT<br>	iptables -A GROUP -p udp -m udp --dport 29611 -j UDPACCEPT<br>	...<br>	iptables -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp -m udp --dport 29610 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.10:29610<br>	iptables -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/255.255.255.0 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE<br></pre>
                
<p> <i>disclaimer:</i><br>
        Paul said that masquerading can cause problems, however I (Thomas 
Mangin)    haven't noticed any problems using it.  </p>
             
<p> <i>disclaimer to the disclaimer:</i><br>
        Paul stands by his opinion. Masquerading will do weird ass stuff. 
You'll    disappear and reappear in the network randomly.  </p>
             
<h3>BSD users</h3>
               
<p> BSD users should make sure their packet filter allows the UDP  packets 
   sent by Circle through (Circle uses UDP ports 29610 to 29620). To do this 
   you'll need to modify your packet filter's setup. Replace the following 
 line  in your /etc/pf.conf  </p>
             
<pre>	block in quick on $ExtIF from any to any<br>with<br>	block in quick on $ExtIF from any to any<br>	pass in quick on $ExtIF inet proto udp from any to any port 29609 &gt;&lt; 29621<br><br><br><br></pre>
                
<p> <i>Ok, thats the nasty network stuff done with, on to the fun part.</i>
     </p>
             
<h2><a name="Configuration">2. Configuration</a></h2>
                
<p>Once you have Circle up and running, you'll need to enter some information 
   about yourself so that other people can find you. You may also elect to 
 make  some files on your hard disk available to other people on the network, 
 and  specify a directory in which to place files you download.  </p>
             
<p>To do this, choose the "Configure" option in the "Network" menu.<br>
     </p>
         
<h2><a name="people"></a>3. Finding people</h2>
                
<p>To find a person, enter their name or username in the search box, and 
click "Find person". This will bring up a list of people matching your search. 
     </p>
             
<p>Select the person you are looking for and click "Add to acquaintances". 
    This will add their username to your list of contacts on the right hand
   side of the main window. It will also let you specify some options, such
  as whether you want to be told  when they arrive and leave    </p>
                
<p>Circle users are referred to by a nickname. This is usually the username
   they specified, but if two people have the same name, one of them will
have   a number stuck on the end to distinguish them. You may also change
the nickname   to a word of your choosing.  </p>
         
<p>A person will be assigned a nickname if: </p>
         
<ul>
       <li>You search for them, then click the "Add to acquaintances" button; 
  or </li>
       <li>They send you a message. </li>
         
</ul>
            
<p><br>
     </p>
             
<h2><a name="files"></a>4. Finding and downloading files</h2>
                
<p>To search for a file, enter some keywords or the full file name in the
    search box, then press the "Find file" button (just like an internet
search    engine). The Circle will then display a list of matching files
and you can   choose which ones you wish to download.   </p>
             
<h2><a name="messages"></a>5. Sending messages&nbsp;</h2>
                
<p>A list of people you can send messages to is displayed in the right hand
    column of the main window. Click on the "&gt;" arrow next to the person
  you want to talk to, then type in your message in the main area of the
window    and press enter.  </p>
             
<p>As well as talking to people, you can talk on channels, rather like IRC.
    You will have been automatically subscribed to the "#welcome" channel.
 You  can send a message to everyone on "#welcome" by clicking on the "&gt;"
 arrow  next to #welcome and typing your message as before.  </p>
             
<p>You can do a number of other funky things related to messaging. For more 
   information, see the <a href="chat_commands.html">chat commands</a> page.
      </p>
             
<h2><a name="gossip"></a>6. Reading gossip</h2>
                
<p>The Circle has a system for gathering items of news posted by other Circle
    users, called gossip. It uses a trust network, rather like <a
 href="http://www.advogato.org">Advogato</a> except that rather than raph 
   et al being the root of the network, <em>you</em> are. What this means 
is   you can individually tailor the news items you receive by specifying 
people   you trust.  </p>
             
<p>To specify that you trust someone, bring up their details window by clicking
    on their name or searching for them. Then tick the "Trust this person"
 checkbox   and move the slider to specify the degree to which you trust
them.   </p>
             
<p>Once you have specified some people you trust you can view current news 
   items using the "Show hot gossip" option in the "Gossip" menu. You can 
also   post your own gossip using the "Post gossip" option, and other people 
will   be able to read it.   </p>
             
<h2><a name="textmode"></a>7. Text mode (<tt>circle -t</tt>)</h2>
                   
<p>Circle has a text mode for people who are too manly to use graphical interfaces. 
  <br>
     The text only interface can be started by running :  </p>
              
<pre>      circle -t</pre>
           
<p>In text mode, you will need to use the weird commands described on the 
<a href="chat_commands.html">Circle commands</a> page.    </p>
              
<p>However, text mode isn't as capable as graphical mode (you cannot use Gossip
in text mode).<br>
     </p>
         
<p>All the Circle commands that exist in text mode can also be used in the 
  chat window of the graphical interface. <br>
     In this window, it is also possible to click with your mouse pointer 
on  the results returned by most Circle commands.<br>
     <br>
     </p>
         
<h2><a name="goofey"></a>8. Running goofey in the chat window</h2>
                
<p>If you don't know what goofey is, you don't need to read this section.
     </p>
             
<p>The Circle can run arbitrary shell commands in the main area of the window.
    Simply prefix the command with a double slash ("//"). So, for example,
 you  can run goofey by typing:  </p>
             
<p><b>//goofey</b>  </p>
             
<p>And of course you can do all the other goofey things goofey can do.  </p>
             
<p><b>Note:</b> Goofey does not work on masquerading networks, even if you 
   start a proxy with The Circle.  </p>
             
<h2><a name="apt-method"></a>9. Using the apt methods</h2>
                
<p>(If you don't use Debian/Fink/Connectiva or something else that uses apt 
   to download packages to install, then you can ignore this section -- though 
   you should consider changing your operating system distribution to something 
   that does use apt!)  </p>
             
<p>The <tt>cftp</tt> and <tt>chttp</tt> apt methods will have been installed
    when you ran setup.py (or installed the Circle package if anyone ever
gets   around to packaging Circle nicely).  </p>
             
<p>Edit your <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> file, changing all occurrences 
   of <samp>ftp://</samp> to <samp>cftp://</samp>, and all <samp>http://</samp> 
   occurrences to <samp>chttp://</samp>.  </p>
             
<p>When you next do <samp>apt-get install foo</samp>, apt will first try
searching the circle network for the package before falling back to the correspondingly-named 
   non-circle method.  </p>
             
<h2><a name="plug-ins"></a>10. Using plug-ins</h2>

A number of circle plug-ins are provided in the plug-ins directory.
In order to activate one of them, you need to put the corresponding
file in your ~/.circle/plug-ins directory. The plug-in will be loaded 
on startup.
 
<br>
