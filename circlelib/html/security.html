    <h1>Analysis of Susceptibility to Attack</h1>

<h2>Sending attachment objects</h2>

<p>Limited by UDP packet size (64KiB), so can't DoS through memory usage
with a single sent object; but can by sending <var>n</var> objects
(for some large <var>n</var>).  Here the attacker is constrained by network;
need to send many MB over network, so need to use either cheap network or
someone else's network.

<p>The `trust' measure might be used to reduce this source of DoS:
giving priority to using memory for things sent by people trusted
more.


<p>Can't send executable code as python object: can only send python
objects that can be created through <code>safe_pickle.safe_load</code>.


<h2>Spoofing: Masquerading as someone More Trusted</h2>

<p>Circle uses a public/private key pair for some things.  [Can
someone be more specific?  Is every single packet signed and
signature-checked?]

<p>There is no associated passphrase, so anyone who can access the
<span class="file">private_key</span> file data can circumvent this
measure.

<p>Currently the <span class="file">~/.circle</span> directory and
<span class="file">~/.circle/private_key</span> file are created with
the default umask; presumably at least <span
class="file">private_key</span> ought to be chmod'ed to 0600 or 0400.

<p>Even if chmod'ed to 0400, the file can still be accessed by any
process with either root privilege or access to the device file.  Many
setuid programs have at some point had a vulnerability allowing access
to files.

<p>If <span class="file">~/.circle/private_key</span> is
network-mounted, then even packet-sniffing suffices to see the file.
